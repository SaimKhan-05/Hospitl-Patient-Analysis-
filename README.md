# Hospitl-Patient-Analysis-

## Overview of Key Insights
This dataset provides detailed statistics on patients' ages, costs incurred during treatments, length of hospital stays, and recovery outcomes, segmented by diseases and demographics. The average patient age across all conditions is approximately 54 years, with variations depending on the disease [sheet:average age of patient]. Cost analysis shows that serious conditions such as cancer and heart attack tend to incur higher expenses, upwards of 18,000 to 25,000 units [sheet:avg cost].â€‹

## Disease-Specific Analysis
Common diseases like appendicitis, fracture, hypertension, and respiratory infections are frequently treated, with significant variability in costs, recovery outcomes, and patient satisfaction [sheets:top common disease, disease and outcomes, average services satisfaction]. The dataset also reveals that the average length of hospital stay is around 37.7 days, slightly longer for male patients and in conditions like stroke or cancer [sheet:average patient time], which impacts overall hospital resource management.

## Outcomes and Satisfaction
Recovery and stability are used as outcome indicators, with most patients recovering or remaining stable post-treatment [sheet:disease and outcomes]. Satisfaction ratings generally hover between 3 and 4, with female patients reporting marginally higher satisfaction levels than males, especially in recovery scenarios [sheet:average servies satisfaction].

## KPIs and Dashboard
The KPIs show an average patient age of around 54 years, with an average treatment cost of approximately 8,367 units and an average hospital stay of 37.7 days, which helps evaluate hospital performance [sheet:KPIS]. The dashboard consolidates these insights visually, making it easier for hospital administrators to track performance metrics, disease trends, and patient outcomes [sheet:Dashboard].

## Summary
This extensive data aids healthcare providers in optimizing diagnostic, treatment, and resource allocation strategies. It also provides insights into patient demographics, treatment efficacy, and satisfaction levels, which can enhance hospital management and patient care quality.
